* Clearing Canvas in HTML

** Create Canvas Element
   Start by creating a canvas element in your HTML. Give it an `id` for easy reference in your JavaScript code.
   #+BEGIN_SRC html
   <canvas id="myCanvas" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
   #+END_SRC

** Get Canvas Context
   Obtain the 2D rendering context of the canvas using JavaScript.
   #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
   const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
   const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
   #+END_SRC

** Clear Canvas
   To clear the canvas, you can use the `clearRect` method of the 2D context. This method erases the entire canvas or a specific rectangular area.
   #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
   function clearCanvas() {
     context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
   }
   #+END_SRC

** Call Clearing Function
   You can call the `clearCanvas` function whenever you want to clear the canvas.
   #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
   // Call the function to clear the canvas
   clearCanvas();
   #+END_SRC

By using the `clearRect` method with coordinates `(0, 0)` for the starting point and `canvas.width` and `canvas.height` for the width and height, respectively, you ensure the entire canvas is cleared. Adjust these values if you want to clear only a specific area.

Remember, clearing the canvas doesn't "undo" previous drawingsâ€”it simply makes the canvas area transparent. You'll need to redraw any desired elements after clearing.

For more complex scenarios, you can combine canvas clearing with other drawing operations to create dynamic and interactive graphics.

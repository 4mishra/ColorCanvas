* Adding and Removing Layers on Canvas in HTML

** Create Canvas Element
   Start by creating a canvas element in your HTML. Give it an `id` for easy reference in your JavaScript code.
   #+BEGIN_SRC html
   <canvas id="myCanvas" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
   #+END_SRC

** Get Canvas Context
   Obtain the 2D rendering context of the canvas using JavaScript.
   #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
   const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
   const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
   #+END_SRC

** Create Layer
   To create a new layer, you can use an offscreen canvas. This offscreen canvas will serve as your layer, and you can draw on it just like the main canvas.
   #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
   const layerCanvas = document.createElement('canvas');
   layerCanvas.width = canvas.width;
   layerCanvas.height = canvas.height;
   const layerContext = layerCanvas.getContext('2d');
   #+END_SRC

** Draw on Layer
   You can draw on the layer canvas just like you would on the main canvas. Use the `layerContext` to perform drawing operations.
   #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
   function drawOnLayer() {
     layerContext.fillStyle = 'blue';
     layerContext.fillRect(50, 50, 100, 100);
   }
   #+END_SRC

** Composite Layers
   To show the layer on the main canvas, you can use the `drawImage` method of the main context.
   #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
   function compositeLayers() {
     context.drawImage(layerCanvas, 0, 0);
   }
   #+END_SRC

** Remove Layer
   To remove a layer, you can clear the content of the offscreen canvas.
   #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
   function removeLayer() {
     layerContext.clearRect(0, 0, layerCanvas.width, layerCanvas.height);
   }
   #+END_SRC

** Call Layer Functions
   Call the functions to perform layer-related operations.
   #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
   // Create and draw on the layer
   drawOnLayer();

   // Composite the layer onto the main canvas
   compositeLayers();

   // Remove the layer
   removeLayer();
   #+END_SRC

By using an offscreen canvas as a layer, you can easily manage and manipulate different drawing elements. Layers can be added, drawn on, composited, and removed independently, providing a flexible approach to creating complex graphics on the canvas.

Remember that layers are a virtual concept in this context. You're essentially drawing on separate canvases and combining their content to achieve layering effects.
